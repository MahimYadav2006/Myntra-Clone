# 🛍️ Myntra React Clone

A full-stack e-commerce web application inspired by [Myntra](https://www.myntra.com/), built using **React + Redux** for the frontend and **Node.js + Express** for the backend.

> 🚀 This is a personal project to learn and implement concepts of frontend architecture, Redux state management, API integration, routing, and server setup without a database.
